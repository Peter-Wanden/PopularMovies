## Why this project
To become an Android developer, you must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. 
Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, 
and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You hone these fundamental skills by completing this project.

By building this app, you demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. 
The app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

## What Will I Learn After Stage 1?
